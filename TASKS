1. Get the scientific names of all distinct species found in June, July, and
August of 1990 and later. Sort them alphabetically by species name, then by
year (most recent first) and month (most recent first).

2. For each year after 2000, find the number of individuals and the average 
weight for each species trapped in that year. Order by year, then by the number 
of individuals trapped.

3. For each rodent species in the portal database, find their mass from the
Mammal Life History dataset (mlh_species) and also from the Masses of Mammals
dataset (mom_species). Display species name and both masses side by side as 
well as the absolute difference between them.

4. We want to discover if there were any recording errors made when inputting
weights in July of 2007. To do this, we'll compare each individual's weight
with the weight of that species from the mlh_species table and see if there's
a large discrepancy. Think about what result will be most useful to a 
researcher trying to complete this task, and write the best query for the job.
